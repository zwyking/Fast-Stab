# The code of 《Fast-Full-frame-Video-Stabilization-with-Iterative-Optimization》
The code and video results will be coming soon.


* # Synthetic Dataset
You can run ```python assets/save_training_video_to_disk.py``` to prepare your synthetic dataset. Of course, the corresponding datasets should be prepared firstly (illustrated in the main paper). Then, you should also adjust the directory path in ```save_training_video_to_disk.py```, including ```--image_data_path, --csv_path, --save_dir, coco_path```.
